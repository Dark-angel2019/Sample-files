Those stories are devastating, and I want to be a voice for them on those issues."

Obama did make such a statement in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle. But he wasn't president then.
Mr. Obama was different. He had that cool name. He was black. He'd never done much that was important, save give some fun speeches, but that was OK; neither had most college students, and that didn't keep them from being special either. More important, they believed his promises, they liked his style, they bought his easy answers and flattering pandering.

"It's not so much the volume of snow that we've had. It's been that the timing of the storms has been perfect," Linde said. "They've all been good upslope storms when we benefit.

A: (Starts laughing.) Shaq is a great guy. I love him to death. He always likes to have a lot of fun, especially with me. I was doing his Shaq Shoe Giveaway for the Christmas holidays and I made the mistake of giving him the microphone, and he roasted me in front of about 300 boys and girls from the YMCA.

Maybe Cooper never had to play such bad Michigan teams as Tressel does now, but, in that regard, you can't say enough about Rich Rodriguez, Carr's successor. He is a one-trick pony, running the spread offense before he had the personnel for it and chasing off talented players like quarterback Ryan Mallett (to Arkansas) and lineman Justin Boren (to, of all places, Ohio State). Rich Rod's team will go a bowl at last this year, albeit one low in significance and high in indifference.

What you start seeing is art included in the building of infrastructure. (City Hall) includes art in how it's built, in the outdoor seating areas, the streetscape and the artworks along the street. That all makes a community more livable and makes it a place where you want to be, where you want to bring business and do business."

The NFL knows a painful day is coming. With help from places such as the Boston University center, and more education, we're learning more about the effects of concussions and brain damage. We're learning frightening things and the league has publicly acknowledged the link itself, and taken some measures to help try to protect its current players.

Failure to raise the meaningless debt ceiling for the first time in American history (the same one that was upped seven times under President George W. Bush and 18 times under President Reagan) would have disastrous results: U.S. standing worldwide would be shaken; interest rates for all individuals and businesses would increase; growth, jobs and economic recovery would reverse; and, in sum, result in an economic and humanitarian catastrophe. Default, or even near default, would make our financial situation much worse and much more difficult to fix.

While the federal government requires banks and mortgage companies to disclose interest rates and total payments on loans, the financial aid letters sent out by colleges are often unclear about how much families will have to pay.

A. Early October rains may have caused new sod to suffer root rot problems. Reduce waterings to only when the soil and turf begin to dry, which should be about once a week. If you haven't by now, apply a fungicide to prevent further decline. A number of products are available at local garden centers. Also, apply a starter fertilizer for new lawns available at your garden center following label instructions. These usually contain the three major nutrients needed for good root growth and disease resistance. This should feed your lawn until late winter, when the first-of- the-year fertilizer is applied at the end of February or early March.

He once stole flowers from a church cemetery to bring to a legendary chef of Roman cuisine.

In general, low-budget films stand to benefit the most proportionately by winning because they have received less hype and exposure, the report said. Last year’s winner, "The Hurt Locker," reaped $17 million in box office receipts and cost just $11 million to make.

"I think the things that are really wearing me out is the constant negative attacks and all it takes is to hang something out that's not true and then you have to respond and play defense constantly, and if you're playing defense constantly you can't play offense ... .

Fitting the Ravens: The Ravens expect Pro Bowl free safety Ed Reed to play in 2012, so finding a replacement isn’t an immediate need. But it’s something they should soon take care of given Reed’s injuries and his past statements about retirement.

Waxman's are peeled and served with roast chicken, and Bloomfield's are cooked in duck fat.

THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS have been the case example of a good team that doesn't learn from New England. The Colts play the Patriots all the time without understanding that they're better than the Patriots and could prove it any year they steal or borrow the Patriot offense. If Brady is the league's great quarterback, Peyton Manning of the Colts is the league's great passer. But for years, Manning has beaten himself with the play-action game he loves so dearly. Extensive play-action means, among other things, that you respect running plays more than pass plays; and as a play-caller, Manning has that backwards.

As you get more and more use to what we’re doing, where you’re supposed to be then I think catching the football then becomes a little bit more natural.”

Los Angeles city government still has not reckoned with the defining question of what constitutes its "core" services and what it can afford not to do. It has properly protected the Police Department, closed a few small agencies and consolidated some functions. That work should continue, and Villaraigosa should lead it. He has barely a year left as mayor. He would burnish his legacy and leave this city on sounder footing if he would devote his remaining time to balancing the budget and fixing the defects that have created this structural problem.

The meal ended the way it began, with a showstopping surprise a cup of rich warm chocolate with thick whipped cream, and a little shot of bitter German beer.

As Durkin bounces back and forth in time, we become less and less sure what is real and what Martha is imagining.

As written by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec, whose credits include the "Alias" TV show, "Mission Impossible" is essentially a series of elaborate action set pieces. There is exposition thrown in here and there, especially after circumstances force policy wonk William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) to join the team, but that is not the heart of the matter.
Vegetables soon grew from the soil, as did a movement that encouraged youth mentorships and volunteerism. Today, the Georgia Street Community Garden ( www.georgiastreetcc.com and www.georgiastreetgarden.blogspot.com )has grown into a second garden, an orchard, a park and a community center, all under the umbrella of the Georgia Street Community Collective. With the help of donors, Covington purchased a building and rehabbed it into a community center. It is used for holiday meals, coat drives and movie and reading nights. Eventually, a portion will be converted into a library and computer lab for children.

"The Republicans do not want me to emerge from this primary," Barrett told a crowd of a hundred or so at a Waukesha coffee shop last week. "They've made commercials about several candidates (but) they're only running them against me," he said, because "they view me as the strongest candidate."

GOP Speaker of the House John Boehner said the comments were "inappropriate." What? We're not talking about wearing brown socks with black shoes. Limbaugh slandered a young woman for doing what 98% of the women in America have done. This means he slandered independent and moderate women. He also slandered Republicans as well.

The players say they won't accept a hard cap. NHL players felt the same way until a labor dispute ate up the entire 2004-05 season. Hockey has never recovered in the United States, becoming the sport of Claude Rains -- "The Invisible Man" -- unless you have the Versus cable TV channel. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, Stern's former top lieutenant, not only led the bitter hockey fight, he returned with a hard cap and "cost security" on payrolls.

The implementation of a commercial composting program will depend in part on how many participants sign on. Matt Hernandes of Waste Management Inc. said his company is already working with nearby Jewel food stores, and if enough restaurants or other businesses in a centralized area start composting, it makes sense for the company to expand a route or add a new one.
Last week, Yemen's army chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Ahmed Ali Ashwal, was in Washington for talks with Pentagon officials. The U.S. is pushing Yemen to reorganize its military so that it is better positioned to retake the towns now held by Al Qaeda, an effort that will require tanks and other heavy weapons, U.S. officials said.

"I have one comment about it, then I want to leave it alone. The professionalism and the integrity of the game is very, very important to me. I am a big believer in right is right and wrong is wrong. And that was wrong yesterday. It was very wrong," Tracy said. "To see Major League Baseball react to the situation in the manner in which it did, it just fortifies the importance of the professionalism and integrity of the game."
But an opinion that in theory is eminently just threatens to result in a manifest injustice in Baltimore. At first blush, the high court's ruling appears to bolster the case of former Baltimore Catholic school teacher John J. Merzbacher, who was sentenced to four life terms on six counts of child rape and sexual abuse and faced 100 other charges for similar crimes. He destroyed dozens of lives, and despite his age (70) and years in prison, his victims still fear for themselves, their children and for the community. But a federal judge agreed last year with his contention that he was never informed of a plea offer, and that echoes the circumstances of one of the cases the Supreme Court addressed this week. For what he has done, Mr. Merzbacher deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison. Fortunately, the court ruling leaves open several avenues for Maryland officials to make sure he does.
According to federal authorities and the indictment, Schwartz and his brother, Rabbi Mordchai Fish, agreed to launder money they believed Dwek got from illegal activities such as bank fraud, selling of counterfeit merchandise and bankruptcy fraud.

Mayor Alvin Parks said he had no immediate reaction to Durbin's comments but would hold a news conference on the matter today. The mayor has said that the clubs bring in much-needed tax revenue, which helps to keep police officers on the streets.
Quinn also proposes making school districts, community colleges and universities pay a small part of the cost of their employees' pensions. Most pay nothing now. The Republican leadership rejects this, saying it would force school districts to raise property taxes. We don't buy that, given the small amount districts would be asked to pay. But Quinn is wise to separate this issue from his larger plan.

Concussion is a medical condition about which there is a lot of misinformation. Many parents believe your child must be a star athlete to experience a concussion.

Because of the program's structure, many long-term owners enjoy steep discounts on their tax bills, while recent buyers pay the full cost, the recent Sun investigation documented.

The Wolves center grew up in Kendallville, Ind., which is a couple hours' drive from Indianapolis. He played college ball at Purdue and he played two seasons here with the Pacers. So it's no surprise that Miller's locker was surrounded by local reporters before the game, nor that he played a season-high 25:20, scoring five points. Miller said he bought more than 60 tickets for the game.

The upheaval of today's Middle East is surely comparable to the disorder in Europe that followed the French revolution and, under Napoleon's banner, spread military turmoil across the continent. The Middle East still hasn't absorbed the Iranian revolution of 1979, let alone the Arab Spring that is shaking the Sunni world. It's a region begging for a new concert of nations that accommodates conservative monarchies and new republics.

About 1.5 million, or 53.6%, of bachelor's degree holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed, the highest share in at least 11 years, according to government statistics and analysis by university researchers. In 2000, the share was at a low of 41%, before the dot-com bust erased job gains for college graduates in the telecommunications and IT fields. Out of the 1.5 million who struggled in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year, the AP study found.

One highly recommended adult vaccination protects against three serious bacterial diseases: tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. Tetanus causes painful muscle spasms and stiffness; if head and neck muscles are affected, patients may be unable to open their mouths (a condition known as "lockjaw"). About one in five tetanus cases is fatal. Diphtheria produces a thick membrane over the back of the throat and can eventually lead to breathing issues, paralysis, heart failure or death. Pertussis (whooping cough) causes severe coughing fits and may lead to complications, including pneumonia.

WHAT YOU REALLY WANT to know, Mr. and Ms. No-Longer-at-the-Center-of-the-Car-Universe, is: How will it affect me? This will be a case-by-case question driven mostly by product-planning arithmetic, but in some ways it's already happening. Luxury car makers' front-end designs, from Buick to Volvo, increasingly reflect Chinese-market tastes. The results are not always auspicious; witness the Bentley sport-ute concept.

Dommen orchestrates a gutsy turn with the house-made duck ravioli ($12.50).

The game hamfistedly tries to evoke classic moments from the film, with secondary objectives such as buzzing a control tower with a flyby or snapping a photo of an enemy plane. It's clear the designers loved "Top Gun" as much as any fan, but the execution doesn't do the action classic justice. Aficionados will notice the details that carry over from the film, but the feeling is one of nostalgia for the film more than excitement to play the game. Maybe there will be a downloadable beach volleyball level at some point in the future.
Huntsman operates Stump Hill Farm near Massillon in northeast Ohio, which cares for and exhibits native and exotic animals ranging from tigers to coyotes to parrots. State officials had believed last fall that her farm could be a potential new home for Thompson's animals.

Morley was elected to the township council in 2010, along with Councilmen Chris Del Borrello and Giancarlo D'Orazio.
On a voice vote in early April, the House backed the date shift as part of a bigger game and fish package.

Credit reporting bureaus sent Asset more than a half-million disputes by consumers in 2008 and 2009.

And Monday, at least, Fudge showed every sign of being a very fast learner. She shared the rostrum with her mother and her pastor.

Results of a preliminary study presented Saturday at the American Assn. for Cancer Research’s annual meeting in Chicago suggest metformin slowed the growth of prostate cancer tumors. The study involved 22 men with prostate cancer. All of them were scheduled to have their prostates removed, and some of them took metformin for about seven weeks beforehand. After the prostates were excised, researchers from Toronto compared them and found that tumors grew more slowly in men who took the diabetes drug than in men who didn’t.

But minutes earlier in a talk with Jewish leaders about his recent sojourn to the Holy Land, Christie hyped his role in the Romney campaign.

Long considered a spring tonic, nettles are loaded with enough protein, iron, vitamins and minerals to edge them right into super food territory.

Recent fare analysis by the Airlines Reporting Corp. seems to challenge the conventional wisdom that the earlier you book, the less expensive your fare will be.

The West has an opportunity in a critical region where it has lost allies in the past few years because of its inability to constrain Iran in the Levant and the Arab gulf region. From the start of the Arab Spring, the Assad regime has, through local media acting as propaganda machines, accused the West of providing financial and logistical support for demonstrators' "terrorist" acts. The West has no positive standing to lose with the Assad regime. But supporting the revolutionaries would help guarantee a state in the Levant that could cooperate with, rather than challenge, the West and build a new relationship of trust with the people of Syria, not their oppressor.

Though this phenomenon is undeniably extreme and uniquely Japanese, there are universal insights we can take from it that might help us to better understand conditions we see in our own schools. If you imagine a context (in Japan, the United States or anywhere) in which a student feels inferior to his peers, receives no compassion from teachers and parents, and observes more despair than hope when he returns home, at least the decision to withdraw in some form begins to make some sense.

Survivors stop to photograph the fluttering green kite. They gaze at the apocalyptic scene of destruction that surrounds. Visible in the distance, out on the coast, is a single tree that survived out of thousands in a famed forest that lined a white-sand beach.

Mattaliano's opera fundamentalism overcame his deficits as a newbie general director. He may have been the least qualified candidate being considered to lead Portland Opera when Robert Bailey retired in 2003. An itinerant stage director at Juilliard, Yale, Princeton, the Metropolitan and New York City Opera companies for 25 years, he knew stages, not boardrooms. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of opera -- call him an opera savant -- but his only experience leading a company was a small summer music festival on Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

Several people have suggested that I sue the dermatologist for malpractice. But I don't want to add to the increasing costs of healthcare. Maybe I'd feel differently if things hadn't turned out all right. But there will always be the risk of human error in medicine, and I believe most doctors genuinely worry about missing a diagnosis or making a mistake with a patient's life.

Is it OK to buy that organic peach in January if it comes from Chile, or is the fuel used to transport it too costly to the planet? What about the lives of the animals killed for food? Or those of the people who work in slaughterhouses or pick strawberries? When words like "sustainable" are marketing tools, how can a consumer figure out what to do? And can a family on a budget afford to eat sustainably?

But as anybody who has frequented L.A.'s power restaurants can tell you — Spago and the Grill on the Alley being the exceptions — the quality of the food is often the least important element in the equation.

Maxwell said that communication between the school system and county government must improve for more collaborative efforts in crafting the budget.

Rio de Janeiro: Rio enjoys a reputation as a dreamy, steamy city, but there's far more to the place than bronzed beauties in thongs. Start with breakfast on the terrace of the elegant Mama Ruisa, an airy 19th century villa turned guesthouse in Santa Teresa, Rio's trendy boho village. Then take a stroll around Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas, the iconic saltwater lagoon on the city's beach strip, ending at Fasano al Mare restaurant in the Fasano Hotel for lunch with a prime view of Ipanema Beach (and the aforementioned bodies). Head to Arpoador Beach for a swim with the surfers, then catch the tram back to Santa Teresa, stopping for a quick pop at Bar do Gomez, a colorful local watering hole spilling onto the cobbled streets. If you're still hungry after trying the empanadas, spend the evening eating artisanal Brazilian food on the jungley patio of Aprazivel, also in Santa Teresa.

One thing led to another, and the idea to continue the "Buffy" story in comics was launched. "I've learned so much about character-driven genre fiction from Joss," Allie says. "Every conflict, every plot point, every bit of drama really stems from who the main characters are. Joss has a phrase that he uses with his writers -- 'What's the Buffy of it?'" For example, if you've got a tale of a three-headed monster that comes to town, and Buffy fights it and kills it, Whedon's concern always is: "What makes it about Buffy?"

Pacifica resident Howard Hall was among those who wrote to tell Fed officials how he had run up $15,000 in card debt after he lost his job in 2001, fell behind in his payments and saw his 8.9 percent rate shoot up to 29 percent - raising his monthly minimum payment to $400. Hall said he was able to climb out of debt because his wife was working and they were able to refinance their home. Now back at work, Hall asked what would happen to a single parent or someone without his advantages "once they fall into a credit death spiral."
The claim: The Sentinel said Marco Rubio is "brimming with ideas…" So said a Rubio mailer. You should always pay extra attention to quotes followed by ellipses … because the rest of the sentence that was cut out said "… though he has tacked too hard to the right in this campaign." Still, the paper did say the first part — and gave Rubio its endorsement.
It's gorgeous to look at, but a little incongruous, given the rest of the artist's career. So it makes sense to follow the example of Val Espinoza, a fellow tourist I met on the steps beneath Rivera's allegory.

Why: Michael Moosbrugger could spend his time working with the profundities of the Gobelsburg estate. But the more low-key Gobelsburger label, from less hallowed fruit, is where his talents truly shine. The 2009 Riesling shows the warm-spice refinement of the Kamptal region, with softer texture and cassia aromas to match lime-blossom flavors. And the tack-sharp 2010 Gruner Veltliner is one to stock away once you find it on shelves. (Importer: A Terry Theise Selection/Michael Skurnik Wines)

“We formed out of two local bands,” McCarty said. “Our guitarist had to quit because his mother wanted him to concentrate on art school. We knew Eric, so we gave him an audition.

The most obvious design element of The Bent Brick will be the waiting area, which has a floor-to-ceiling installation made from unfinished 4-by-6 wood blocks surrounded by an irregularly shaped banquette. The wood block idea was inspired by my 7-year-old son, Mack, who was stacking wood in the backyard and doing it wrong. It looked sort of like what you would end up with if you were playing a game of Jenga, kind of airy, more sculptural than structural. And it occurred to me that would be a good idea for the new place. So I took a few photos and showed them to Mark, with the original thought of using actual pieces of firewood. That had a feel that was a little too lodge-y and rustic, so we switched it over to the rough lumber pieces for a more modern feel.

Now, wearing underwear backward isn't that big of a deal (except that he is always picking his ill-fitting under garments out his rear) but when he wants to wear his pants or shirt the wrong way round, we start to have problems.

Things like, 'No, I am not punishing my child with public humiliation' and 'Because he wants it that way!' and that gets old. And thirdly, haven't you noticed that it's hard to go to the potty when you wear you pants like that?"

Ohio State noted in its response that if Tressel would have reported his knowledge of the players' violations, they probably would have been suspended for the first five games of 2010. So an advantage was gained by Ohio State for only those first five games last season. The school wiped out the entire season anyway, including the bowl win, basically as a show of good faith.

Improved competition typically means less margin for error, Oregon defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti said. Stronger opponents could capitalize on mistakes that might not have been costly against a lesser team.

“Spend time with those kids,” Levert said.
At least 82 children between the ages of 6 and 19 are known to have died while playing the choking game, according to the CDC, although the true toll is probably higher because there’s no reliable system for counting such deaths.

Factory activity weakened this spring, in part because of temporary factors. High gasoline prices forced consumers to spend less elsewhere, which cut demand for factory goods. And the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in Japan led to supply-chain disruptions that slowed U.S. manufacturing production, particularly in the auto and computer industries.
However, even with all this wonderful help - and every university has some form of career counseling (ask for it!) - you still have to do the work.
The high-scoring series has featured plenty of nasty hits and fisticuffs, but Game 4 wasn't nearly as physical. Nobody dropped the gloves, but there were several penalties and a few misconducts.
24. Kendall Reyes, DT, Connecticut, 6-4, 299. Still on the upswing in his career curve, especially given how he pushed around some of the nation's best offensive linemen at the Senior Bowl workouts.

The mother sustained serious injuries, and the driver is in critical condition but is expected to survive, according to Crump. He is expected to face charges of manslaughter and aggravated assault.
Splitting the series seems reasonable -- that is, if the Cardinals plan on making the final few weeks of the season interesting. It's hard to imagine the Cardinals will gain ground on the Braves this weekend. (They missed that chance this week by failing to sweep in Pittsburgh.) But if they split with the Phillies they can keep pace with Atlanta. Win or lose, the Braves benefit every day that drops off the calendar because that's another day the two teams don't have to play. It's possible to look at the pitching matchups through pinched eyes and upside down and see a few edges for the Cardinals. The pivot could be Sunday night when Chris Carpenter pitches opposite Cole Hamels. That could be the game that decides if the Cardinals split the series or return home without a race to alive.
Anthony Bass, a pitcher half Moyer's age, went five innings and gave up three runs. Bass (0-2) also had a career-high seven strikeouts.

His trial on assorted violations of campaign finance law is, perhaps, not the ideal venue for him to spill the beans about his misdeeds on behalf of Democratic candidates — in that context, he's not exactly a reliable witness. But if he has proof that he or others have broken the law on behalf of Democrats, Republicans or anyone else, the public (and prosecutors) would surely love to see it.
NEW YORK — Ike Davis insists this is not a health-related issue.

•Vision/purpose. Does the candidate embrace a strong vision or compelling view of the nation's future? Has the candidate demonstrated a consistent, though not overly rigid, commitment to a set of principles that could energize his White House, as Ronald Reagan did; or does he seem to stand for everything but believe in nothing, as Jimmy Carter was frequently accused of doing?
"If your plans for athletics don't work out you need to have a back-up plan. You can't accomplish anything without having a strong education. Plus if you are a good athlete that means you are discipline and most likely you will be discipline in the classroom as well."
One final idea: the Web 2.0 movement -- of which YouTube is the latest phenomenon, and the biggest to date -- is about the empowerment of individuals to tell their own stories. We may well need greater clarity in the copyright law with respect to digital works to reap the full benefits of user-generated content and to ensure that these stories continue to get told and shared in interesting, meaningful ways.

Mathieu, who is nicknamed Honey Badger, has made numerous game-changing plays for top-ranked LSU. The sophomore cornerback is the second defensive player to be a Heisman finalist in the last three years. Defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh of Nebraska finished fourth in 2009.
"I didn't think I was going to have anybody because I had the fastest time by 30 seconds," Fischer said. "Then Courtney Rogers came up and led six laps. I was trying to stay calm because I knew she was going to try to take off. When we had 800 meters left, I was like, ‘OK, I have to go now.' I probably should have kicked harder too then. I just haven't been lately, I don't know why."

More coverage: The Internet buzzed after Kate Middleton and the fictional Bella Swan (in the "Twilight" movie) wore wedding gowns with long sleeves. Would strapless gowns topple from their perch? Not exactly. "You put a sleeve in the gown and to get a beautiful fit you need a tight armhole, and that really eliminates movement," Durham said. "I've seen brides spin their arms around like a propeller when they're dancing. Sleeves hinder that." Kate's example is being felt, however. Cap sleeves are gaining popularity, as are illusion necklines, as in a strapless dress with a sheer overlay that rises to a boat neck. Longer veils are back, too. More than three in every four women in a David's Bridal survey conducted last fall planned to wear a veil. Many brides are wearing their hair partially down with a veil, as did Middleton, for a modern twist.

Co-worker 1: "So then I said to the guy, '$1.99 for a biscotti? What are you, kidding?' Well, he wasn't kidding, And then when my macchiato came, it was clearly not half-skim, half-soy, which I had specifically asked for, and more like three-quarters skim and who knows what the hell the other quarter was, so I sent it back. And then you should have seen the look on the guy's --"

Gascon was concerned enough about the sincerity of Mirkarimi's guilty plea last week that he had threatened to rescind it and send the sheriff to trial. Mirkarimi had been quoted in the local media, Gascon said Monday, sounding like he was trying to "minimize or to somehow walk away from responsibility in this case."
The Justice Department last month accused the Sheriff's Office of rampant discrimination against Latinos in its police and jail operations, prompting an immediate suspension of Arpaio's participation in federal immigration enforcement.
STINGY UNTIL NOW: In six previous career starts against the Tigers, Beckett had given up two homers.
Even as they tout their own budget proposals, Jordan and LaTourette say they also intend to vote for Paul Ryan's plan.
Hey, Tony: Last week, a reader posed a question as to whether Colt McCoy can be fairly assessed. You answered that he could, because a QB should be assessed by his individual skill-set -- "his arm, his ability to function in the pocket, his ability to see the field and read defenses, his ability to anticipate routes and place the ball where it needs to be." Now, I have no idea if Colt McCoy is the answer, and frankly I do not think he is. But outside the arm element, it seems that every other aspect of your skill-set of your evaluation directly correlates to the QB's grasp of the offense. How well one knows the offense allows him to anticipate routes, helps him to know what to look for in a defense, and the inability to do either of those things results in someone looking skittish in the pocket. I believe you also said Drew Brees had a "noodle-arm" when he was still on the Chargers -- so, who knows? -- Sam Toth, Cleveland Heights
If the regulator were to determine that News Corp. does not meet that test, it could be forced to divest part of its 39 percent stake, depriving it of a controlling interest in the British broadcaster.

What both groups fail to mention is that the fishing program is funded entirely by hunting and fishing fees, which don't come from taxes and aren't legally allowed to be used for anything other than hunting and fishing programs. Whatever your view of the ethical aspects of fishing, none of that $365,000 is being pulled from teacher salaries or road projects.

A special cocktail selection (all $8) is as intriguing as the food menu, but the results are mixed. The idea of a Hot Tomato is good -- a deconstructed bloody Mary with vodka, tomato water, lemon and a dash of Tabasco served in a martini glass with a jalapeno pepper floating in the middle. However, the drink tasted flat. I asked for salt to perk it up, which helped to coax out the sweetness in the fruit.

Pace said the current building's heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems work poorly, a problem that, along with deteriorating roofs, plagues most branches. And even the most minor electrical work to meet computer upgrades usually involves expensive "trenching" through floors at the branches, he said.
"I only let them read it if it gets an award," said the 16-year-old junior at Mehlville High School. Lucky for her parents, and for Marlee, her short story "Sonata in the Key of Bea" recently received a gold medal for the Alliance for Young Artists and Writers' National Scholastic Art and Writing Awards. The award recognized her story as one of the best student literary works in the country. She also received the American Voices Medal, which declared her story the best submission from the Midwest.

Karen Neuman sensed a moment of hesitation from the driver to her right Saturday on Rockside Road at Interstate 77 in Independence. That's how she knew to expect company in her lane . . . again.
When the InterContinental Hotel brand took over the 18th-century mansion Porto Palacio das Cardosas, preserving the landmark's baroque façade, it punctuated the city center's rise. With a flourish. The sprawling cleaned-up villa is now all swish grandeur, outdoing even Lisbon's poshest hangouts. The complex encompasses a wellness center, formal greenhouse restaurant, cafe Astoria (the better culinary choice), and suitably neo-baroque guestrooms, each a swirl of damask, silver-leafed desks, padded leather headboards, marble bathrooms and jewel-toned wing chairs.
"However long the journey, and the arraignment was only the start of a legal process that could take many months," he said, "the United States is committed to gaining accountability for those who attacked and killed innocent people."

The Dromios, Bruce Mackinnon and Felix Hayes, were cast for their superficial resemblance, but even more, as Mr. Hayes says in the program, for "similar mannerisms, speech patterns and comic rhythms." Needless to say, these are mind-blowingly camp.
But for the same governor? Generally speaking, unfathomable.
The restaurant's vegetable "coins" ($13) are reminiscent of Indian kofta - they're fried patties of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and celery. But here they're served in Manchurian sauce, a puree of broccoli with soy sauce, onion and ginger. The result is a comforting dish, if a little greasy, though it's good for absorbing spiciness.
Asked why Mann specifically alleged that Olson used electronic monitoring equipment against her, he said, "She knows how I do my job.'' He predicted that he would be cleared of any wrongdoing and asked that the Star Tribune not report on the investigation. He noted that he's had good relations in the past with reporters.
"I'm feeling much, much better," said Baffert, who gave up his "steak all the time" diet. "I've lost weight, and I needed to lose weight anyway. Every day, I get stronger and stronger. I've been exercising and eating well. I've never eaten so much fish in my life. Things are good."

Hugh Vanstone for "Ghost the Musical"
After the two other No. 2 seeds in the NCAA Tournament, Duke and Missouri, lost their first games, the last two No. 2s, the Buckeyes and Jayhawks, advanced to New Orleans by beating the top seeds in their regions -- Ohio State taking down Syracuse and Kansas dispatching North Carolina. Those wins said more about each team than a game from December, though what happened then is a point of reference.
1. HOLLIDAY SPENDING: The biggest development for the Cardinals in 2010 was also the biggest contract (so far) in Cardinals history. Matt Holliday agreed to a seven-year, $120-million contract last January that is the richest the franchise has ever completed. A big-money player for the first time in his career, Holliday then went out and had one of the best seasons of any outfielder in the NL. He's the first teammate to have a higher average than Pujols in Pujols' career, and Holliday won the Silver Slugger award. Holliday was the only outfielder in the NL to rank in the top 10 in average, on-best percentage and slugging. The year ends with Holliday making another move. Holliday, embracing the role as a franchise fixture, has brought his family north to call the St. Louis area home.

"What's surprising is the breadth of support that these (issues) are the most important to children's health and the consensus that it's up to the community  not just the parents  to be involved," said Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo. He attributed the increase to the growth of awareness of childhood obesity and its related health risks. In a 2003 Field Poll, 35 percent of voters said eating habits and exercise were the top threats to children's health.

A swift setup puts an otherworldly, limitless power source (the mysterious cube seen in the teaser at the end of "Thor") in the hands of Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the banished, power-hungry brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who plans to use it to defeat and subjugate the entire human race. Since the all-powerful cube was in the hands of S.H.I.E.L.D., the secret global organization that acts as the planet's protector, it falls to its director, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), to find a way to get it back.
Emmett McLoughlin came to Phoenix as a newly ordained Franciscan priest, and he became the city's leading advocate for the poor.

"If you turn the clock back four, five years ago, we were taking a roof off, putting a second story on; major kitchen and bathroom remodels," said Dunlap. "Most of those kitchens were in the $70,000, $80,000 range, master bathrooms in the $65,000 range. What we are seeing now is those same folks in the same area are doing what needs to be done to keep their homes functional. There is very little of what we call discretionary remodeling right now."

Jacobs is attracted to the strange. Something called the Odysseus Contract helps us stick to an objective by committing to an ironclad, horrible consequence for failing. He mentions that optimal elimination involves squatting, not sitting. And he passes along the notion that humans' typical wariness of "Others" may be rooted in a reasonable fear of germs.
"I'm a believer in lifelong learning. People get old when they stop learning," said Wise, a retired teacher and child social services policy and program developer who is from Chicago.

øA: You have to have a much longer-term viewpoint. First, you have to change your guidepost. Ask yourself, how much money do I need when I retire? You have to have a strong belief, if you're in good health, that you will live to probably your mid-80s. And if you're a couple who are in your 60s and in good health, statistically, one of the two of you will live to 92. So you need adequacy in your nest egg when you retire to meet those financial needs as you live longer. People today are preoccupied in trying to live a better, longer life. They may be exercising more, taking vitamins, having regular examinations. We do that because we want to live longer. We're so preoccupied with finding a lifestyle that allows us to live longer and more successfully, but we don't take that same horizon when we invest for our retirement. What I'm trying to suggest is once you start to say, I need X dollars in retirement, then you work backwards. You're not going to earn that with zero interest in cash. You're going to need some form of returns, and there are areas where you can earn 4%, 5%, 6% type of returns over a course of a long time, and that's generally shares of dividend-paying companies and other forms of credit such as high-yield and other products that will give you a higher return than cash. So if you needed, let's say, $40,000 pretax to live by or $55,000 pretax to live by, work backwards. Depending on your life, your age, how much money do you need to put away? What type of return do you need to earn to build that nest egg? And I think too few people are focusing on that.

But they are concerned the withdrawals would be averaged out over three months. That could allow a business to exceed the thresholds without applying for a permit. For example, a withdrawal from Lake Erie of 6 million gallons in a single day would not trigger the permitting process when averaged out over 90 days. Supporters of the new plan counter that such doomsday scenarios are impractical.

In short order the voters approved a bond issue of $250,000 and the board purchased 15 acres on Laguna Road between Newport Avenue and Red Hill. The board paid Clarence Bowman and Jacob Fink $41,000 for the property, which included a house that could be used by the superintendent of schools, and hired Mott M. Marston, a Los Angeles architect, to design the building, which would be constructed by local contractors William Bowman and George Preble. That fall about 75 students attended classes in temporary quarters at the Tustin Primary and Grammar School location.
A bonding bill of $500 million to $600 million would serve Minnesota well. It ought to include support for regional convention centers in Rochester, Mankato and St. Cloud. Each is an economy-stimulating regional asset. Another must: funding for the Southwest Corridor light-rail project, which risks losing its place in line for 50 percent federal funding if the state does not act this year.
That the Red Wings are one loss from being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs is on the shoulders of Nashville goaltender Pekka Rinne, who denied enough scoring chances to provide highlights for a week's worth of shows. His heroics were the Wings' undoing, as they fell, 3-1, at Joe Louis Arena. The Predators hold a 3-1 advantage in the best-of-seven series headed into Friday's Game 5 at Bridgestone Arena, site of the Wings' only win last Friday.

“25 to 30 percent of kids in America are overweight or obese,” said Phil Wu, a doctor with Kaiser Permanente, which is sponsoring the film's promotion. To Wu, promoting healthy food is preemptive care. “It’s more efficient to prevent obesity than to treat it once it’s there. The more fresh fruits and vegetables you eat, the better. The less sugar-sweetened beverages you drink, the better. The more low fat milk, the better.”

Actually, the truth hurts. We've taken quite a fall -- one that might not be obvious as Oregon busily restructures its state education leadership and mutely slogs through another year of local school cutbacks. Somehow, our K-12 education system has come to rank among the nation's most fragile on multiple fronts.
The takeaway: The Rams topped Drexel, 59-56, Monday in the CAA title game, ending the Dragons' 19-game winning streak. Troy Daniels, a 6-4 junior, averages 10.0 ppg and is VCU's top 3-point shooter at 38.5 percent. In the win over Drexel, Darius Theus had a career-high 16 points and five steals to lead the Rams, who were the biggest story of last year's NCAA Tournament when they won five times to reach the Final Four. Like last year, the Rams are tough defensively. They allow opponents to shoot 59.8 percent from the field, 23rd nationally; and allow just under 10 assists per game, 18th nationally.

It is also important that the incoming president not only appoint people of differing philosophies, but that he's also willing to listen to their viewpoints as the governing process goes forward. Paul O'Neill may or may not have been the best choice for Treasury secretary in the first term of the Bush administration, but it really didn't matter that much. His own account of his tenure indicates that his principal function was to serve as a potted plant -- hauled out for photo opportunities when the administration wanted to make it appear that he supported its policies despite the fact that he had little input in developing them.
"But I'm torn because I enjoy doing the show so much," he told Wallace. "A lot of people have been telling me, 'Alex, you've got to go for at least 30. You've just done 28. Now, at least do two more.' So that has a nice ring to it. Put in your 30 and go help people."

Tough one. There are some great movies about musicians and some great documentaries. I tend to like the documentaries. I recently watched a documentary on Chet Baker, "Let's Get Lost," and that was very insightful. As far as movies go, "Bird" was good, "Ray" was cool, so was "For Love or Country" (story of Arturo Sandoval), and "Sweet and Lowdown" (a Woody Allen film about a fictional gypsy jazz guitarist), so many others. Not really a "movie," but I've been diggin' on "Stevie Wonder Live at Last" recently.

It wasn't just Clooney who seemed flustered. Sandra Oh, who won the TV best supporting actress award ("Grey's Anatomy") was so befuddled she could barely navigate through the maze of tables on her way to the stage. Others wept.

No one doubts the honest passion of those who fear vaccines. And for some people, no amount of communication or dialogue or reasoning will stop them from worrying. But risk perception is ultimately subjective, a combination of the facts and how those facts feel, and sometimes our fears don't match the evidence. The dangers that sometimes arise because of the way we perceive risk must be managed, too. But we must act in the face of this threat to public health.

In Marion County, where police ranks are too thin and bean counters have spent years desperately trying to close budget gaps, the latest mistake means local government since the start of 2011 received about $34 million less in local income tax disbursements from the state than it deserved.

Henri Dutilleux's Second Symphony, the other major piece on the program, also used the concerto grosso format, but in large scale, with a 12-piece chamber ensemble fronting a very full orchestra. With harpsichord, celeste and timpani among the soloists, the sonorities were captivating in their variety, and the kaleidoscopic transformations of instrumental color both among the soloists and between solo group and orchestra were captivating, thanks in no small part to the meticulous attention of conductor Gregory Vajda. For a piece the symphony has never played in the 50 years since its composition, it sounded extremely well rehearsed, with clean attacks, even momentum through tricky rhythms, and vividly realized textures.

In a healthier world, Congress should have argued for different option. In January, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued new guidelines for school lunches, as mandated by a 2004 act of Congress. The new rules called for limiting starchy vegetables, reducing sodium and raising the amount of tomato sauce that could be considered a vegetable serving, among other changes. The frozen pizza and french fry lobby was not pleased. According to the New York Times, the food industry spent $5.6 million lobbying against the new rules.

The doc is willing to help, but is understandably worried about "what happens if 'the other guy' says no." The talented Mark Ruffalo is the latest in a long line of Hulk portrayers, and perhaps the best.
Despite these high rankings, downtown is still suffering the aftershocks of the recession, and the office market is working to regain its foothold. Because of corporate downsizing and relocations, a number of older office towers are struggling to compete. If Exelon wishes to create a net positive impact, it should evaluate its real estate options in the context of today's office market.
On the down side, sales for the Focus compact car fell 10 percent during the final month of the year. Ford is replacing the Focus with a new model this spring that it promises will get better fuel economy and offer more features.
Apple sticks to its own timetable. When they show off the iPad 2, they'll be in a position to show off the whole, completed work.

Ideally, using whatever money you might have earmarked for an Android 3.0 slate.

That would be a mistake -- at least this early in the careers of both rookies. Jamison's presence is benefiting the club, and specifically the two first-rounders. Despite a few dubious shooting nights -- notably 6-of-20 in the opener against Toronto -- he is the only other starter besides Irving creating his own shot. That can't be overstated. Take away Jamison, and Irving loses one of his best options as well as a player who can stretch the defense and create lanes for the penetrating point guard.
"It's pretty much a status quo budget," said budget director Gary Wallis. "Citizens won't see any significant differences in how the city operates or in the services provided."

Is there any recognition at the absolute highest levels of team ownership/management of two huge sources of future problems ... 1. The Sox have simply been unable to develop an effective farm system under Ken Williams (witness recent Baseball America ratings); and 2. The apparent deficit in organizational talent evaluation that has led to all of the bad trades and free agent signings. Where is the next Al Goldis, who was key to the jackpot of talent the Sox developed in the early '90s (e.g., Thomas, Fernandez, McDowell, Ventura -- even Alvarez through the Himes trade). Now that was a farm system. -- M. Peregrine; Glencoe

Square Books was my first stop in Oxford. I walked east on Van Buren Avenue from the 5 Twelve Bed & Breakfast, passing the Old Venice Pizza Co., once the site of Devoe's Gathright-Reed Drug Co., whose lending library Faulkner frequented a century ago. For years, Gathright-Reed was one of the few places in town to sell Faulkner's books; until relatively late in his career, Faulkner was largely disregarded in Oxford, referred to as "Count No-Count" for his aloofness and his apparent aversion to hard work. This, of course, was not merely a local perspective: Before the 1946 publication of "The Portable Faulkner," which collected and contextualized his writing, most of his books were out of print.

“If I can keep (the right knee) feeling good, then I think I can get back to my old self,’’ Roy said. “The left one, I’ve always had to deal with. But when the right one started bugging me consistently, it made me feel like I didn’t have a leg to depend on.’’
Cold, cloudy conditions gave way to pleasant sunshine about the time Couples revved up the gallery with three straight birdies to close out the front nine. He knocked down a pitching wedge from 105 yards to tap-in range, then rolled in a 35-foot putt up the hill on the ninth. The loudest cheer came on the par-3 16th, when his 18-foot birdie putt eased down a slope and disappeared.

The album enters a sweet spot with Track Six, the Punch Brothers' "Dark Days," and remains there through Track 10, Glen Hansard's "Take the Heartland." A highlight of that solid stretch is the rambunctious "One Engine" by the Decemberists, the Grammy-nominated troupe that has made a career of twisting complicated concepts into tuneful bliss. Another is the Carolina Chocolate Drops' old-timey "Daughter's Lament," which nicely showcases Rhiannon Giddens' memorable voice. The Civil Wars' plaintive "Kingdom Come" is undeniably lovely -- but not a track I'd want to listen to multiple times.
The glistening court beckoned. As Bowie filed onto the hardwood behind 26-year-old guard/stand-up comedian Terry Hosley, general manager John Wolfe — a man with admittedly no basketball experience — looked on from the sideline. Coach Bob Topp, who spent much of the day working 15 miles down the road as a middle-school athletic director, rolled a half-dozen basketballs underneath the hoop with the help of his college-age daughter. Players continued to trickle in, some wearing the business wear of their 9-to-5 existences.

Because it was performed out of sequence and some of the pieces are largely explicative, it took a while for the show to flow properly and gain momentum. Eventually, it did, though, and highlights such as the lovely harmonies on "Goodbye Blue Sky," the bump-and-grind of "Young Lust" - complete with the pole dancers - and the full-on arena rock of "Run Like Hell" shone through.

Apple's philosophy is no mystery. They see computing as a collection of functions, not a range of hardware or a suite of apps. Those functions should articulate themselves differently depending on where the user is and how deeply they want to get involved. And although these functions should be re-optimized for specific experiences (the phone, the tablet, the desktop) the experience should be so consistent that it all feels of a piece.

I had another embarrassing experience when I was a freshman at Yale. I took a psychology class and remember almost nothing about the class. One morning, the professor started talking about sex. I was seated in the front row and fainted. I dramatically fell on the floor. When I became conscious, the professor asked another student to escort me to the infirmary. I remember very little about the fainting experience. Again this experience might teach one to expect the unexpected.
A I wish I had words of wisdom. Long-term care insurance is among the more difficult products to decide on. It's also an evolving product that I think is heading in a good direction with intriguing hybrid policies combining life insurance or annuities with long-term care. However, these products are relatively new and complex. In the meantime, my advice on whether someone should buy a policy is essentially "it depends."
"I don't think there are any guarantees in this situation, from what it sounds like," he said. "He really needs to come in and prove not only to the coaching staff, but to the players that he's really a changed guy- not only in spring training or that first month of the season, but he's got to carry that over through the rest of the season. That's the big thing. That's going to be a huge thing, trust-wise, for the players and the organization, to see if this is going to be a long term thing."

We wish to continue to control it with best practices of land management and production of food to feed the world.

The WHL also fined Laxdal $500 for comments he made following the Oil Kings’ 5-1 loss in Game 2 Friday when he criticized referees Matt Kirk and Nathan Wieler as well as the replay officials.

Ignoring caution, my husband, Greg, and I decided to return to the islands, our first visit in 10 years. We were drawn by the Savusavu Music Festival, an annual event that brings in music groups from all over the South Pacific, and we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. And then there is the small thrill we derive from ignoring travel warnings -- unless artillery is involved. It wasn't.
For Sweeney, Christie’s line-item vetoes of the Democrats’ $30.6 billion budget just days later went beyond what he called human decency. The governor cut most state aid for New Jersey’s struggling cities and decreased funds for tuition aid grants, an AIDS drug distribution program and nursing homes, among other things — all beyond the original budget he proposed in February.
But Erwin Chemerinsky, University of California, Irvine's law school dean, argued that the Arizona law is a far more brazen attempt to regulate immigration than either the Texas or Proposition 187 cases.

A major problem with teens, says psychotherapist Marcia Polansky, a professor at Drexel University School of Public Health in Philadelphia, is that even when the divorce is good for the parents, the kids like having both of them in the house, "even if the parents aren't getting along, even if they're quite unhappy together."

Hey, Tony: Read your article about kickers becoming "too good." I'd like to get your opinion on the following rule change which would take effect when I become king: On kickoffs, if the ball is kicked out-of-bounds on the fly, penalty places the ball on the 40, as presently. If it bounces or rolls out-of-bounds before getting to the end zone, the receiving team takes possession at that yard line, just like a punt. I think the change would add an interesting element to the game, requiring more precision than distance kicking, and may cause receiving teams to use two returners to cover the field, reducing the number of blockers by one, or risk bad field position. BTW, I happen to enjoy watching teams (not QB'd by Elway) try to succeed in 90-yard drives. -- Seren Hrachian, Athens, N.Y.

Two years later, history looks likely to repeat itself. Mujica is not running against Lipinski again, but he is the chief advisor to the Chicago Police officer, Farah Baqai, who is. Mujica, in fact, sat at the table with Baqai when she and Lipinski met with the Sun-Times Editorial Board. Baqai, like Mujica, is an outspoken progressive on social issues, especially with respect to abortion rights, though her emphasis in the campaign has been on the need to create jobs.

"The Bengals blew it with their draft. They could have had DeCastro and Kendall Wright. Instead, they drafted needs more than talents. Kirkpatrick is nothing special. Zeitler as well. DeCastro will be making pro bowl year after year and the Bengals chose Zeitler instead...and they had the opportunity to add an absolutely dynamic receiver next to Green, but they chose to draft the average corner in Kirkpatrick and then take Sanu later to make up for it. Kendall Wright is on a whole different level than Sanu.

Ending the guesswork. It's tiring work even for a young DIY-er to hold a level while positioning a picture frame for hanging.

In "Prague Winter," her compelling new memoir, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright emphasizes the importance of leadership -- or its lack -- in world affairs. As a woman, she is the Czechoslovakian-born daughter of Josef Korbel and Anna Spiegelova. As a diplomat, she is a daughter of Munich, the infamous agreement that turned part of her country over to Nazi Germany. She rebuts Tolstoy, "who argued that scholars routinely exaggerate the ability of the great and powerful to control events," by citing the weak and vacillating leaders who failed to recognize evil and stand up to Hitler.

Wind energy will one day play a significant role in America's energy future, as will other renewables. But that day will not come anytime soon, for it takes years to acquire approvals and permits, secure financing and build the infrastructure. America's oil and natural gas companies believe in alternative energy, and that is why they are investing billions of dollars in developing the technologies that will get us to a green energy future. But they are also working to make certain that Americans have the energy they need in the meantime.

The use of drone aircraft perpetuates the illusion that military force is an effective means of countering terrorism and resolving political differences. We should know better by now. After 10 years of combat in Afghanistan the threat of terrorist attack and insurgent violence remains as great as ever. May 2011 was the deadliest month for Afghan civilians since the U.N. began keeping records in 2007, the agency's Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reported. June's death toll was almost as high.

A rare strain of E. coli -- O104:H4 -- on sprouts produced in north-western Germany killed about 30 people, including one in the United States, and sickened more than 3,000. That outbreak -- with a record death toll -- had an unusually high number of people suffering from kidney failure. E. coli O104:H7 has never been reported in the United States and has rarely been seen abroad. But E. coli are always changing, offering the potential to mutate into deadly strains.

The Portland forward scored 24 points, but he never got on the sort of roll that made him dominant earlier in the series. Tyson Chandler and Brendan Haywood deserve credit for that.

As logging industrialized, poor men became rich, and a rich landscape became poor. After arriving in America in 1852 as an 18-year-old German immigrant, Frederick Weyerhaeuser later controlled a logging empire valued at $70 million. Apart from canny purchasing of timberlands around the Great Lakes, his masterstroke was forming a syndicate of formerly rival lumber companies. By breaking logjams of wood being floated down the Mississippi, everyone's production improved; at the same time, cut land around the Great Lakes became a tinderbox. In 1871, Wisconsin's Peshtigo fire seared 2,000 square miles and claimed more than a thousand lives. In the Badger State alone, more fires followed in 1891, 1894, 1897, 1908, 1910, 1923, 1931 and 1936. "Losing half a million acres in a year was almost commonplace," Rutkow observes.

Wallace and Valdez have been imprisoned for 11 years -- in separate cells (rendered with a suitably squalid minimalism by scenic designer Cameron McFee) near enough for conversation -- and systematically brutalized to no end that they can surmise. “I mean, what kind of place is it, Wallace, where they torture you and they don’t even want to know anything?” Valdez asks. “I’m no longer sure,” Wallace replies. “If there was such a thing as an engine that ran on human agony, I’d say that’s where we were.”
Despite this, Americans aren't notably healthier than people in other advanced countries, the study reports. Life expectancy in the United States (78.2 years) lags behind Japan's (83 years) and the OECD average (79.5 years). It roughly equals Chile's and the Czech Republic's, says Mark Pearson of the OECD. Americans don't have much to show for their system's enormous cost, even if the gaps in life expectancy partly reflect differences in lifestyle and diet.

They're made from cranberry concentrate, and most mix in lots of white grape juice concentrate and/or apple juice to add sweetness -- or sugar. Often, there's more of the other fruits than the cranberry. But these are drunk for fun, not for the antioxidant benefits of cranberries.

The Detroit Tigers have trained in Lakeland — between Tampa and Orlando — since 1930 and have played in the current park, Joker Marchant Stadium, since 1966. The Philadelphia Phillies have played in Clearwater since 1947, and the Pittsburgh Pirates have called Bradenton’s McKechnie Field home for the past 43 years, although the place got a complete and much-needed facelift in the 1990s.

But how can anybody criticize a player for doing what's best for him and his family?

When the fungus has rotted away the stump, you could remove the structure, unless you end up liking it there.

But at every turn, author Sparks hurls obvious melodramatic obstacles in the way, rubs the edge off even unpleasant characters and generally shows us why he'd be the worst poker player on the planet.

“In a nutshell, its been co-opted by the industry, so on one hand they have some mission of only supporting ‘independent’ stores, but then the bulk of releases are overpriced crap from major labels - the same ones that tried to destroy indie stores back when they had any power in the 1990s,” Steinhardt says. “On top of that, I think the collector culture of vinyl is really dangerous for the longevity of the format.

His injury creates a void in both the outfield and at the top of the Mets lineup.

The back story: Prana has been so consistently popular that it's hard to remember it was a restaurant, La Mezzanine, until 2001. Today it's Ybor City's only five-story nightclub.

On the surface, "Through," a premiere, might seem to be of the same order as "Swipe." Cong is the resident choreographer of the Tulsa Ballet and, like Caniparoli, a hybridizer, taking from various idioms to forge a contemporary ballet. But Cong, with a pastiche of music compositions by Ryuichi Sakamoto that became increasingly schmaltzy, and despite obvious talent, lacks Caniparoli's capacity to layer. He tends toward the sentimental and superficial, like Smuin, but unlike Smuin, the pas de deux are mechanical and virtuosic, not emotive, reducing "Through's" abundant circles, lifts and leaps to pyrotechnics. While the rich action was always moving somewhere, it lacked the depth that makes us feel the human poetry of motion.

Or does it? After the first episode of “Luck” aired last week, message boards were full of complaints about the sound quality. It was hard to hear what the actors were saying, particularly Nolte and John Ortiz, who played Peruvian trainer Turo Escalante. Kevin Dunn, whose character is in a wheelchair and uses an oxygen tank, spoke into the mask at one point. When the dialogue was audible, it was hard to decipher. Many of the characters spoke cryptically and used a racetrack/gambler patois unfamiliar to the uninitiated. HBO anticipated that problem and put a glossary on its website, defining “pick six” and “bug boy” for those who’ve never been to Santa Anita, much less Portland Meadows.

Early experiences taught Keller to treat each ingredient with care and respect. He recalls the time he accidentally snapped the leg of a rabbit when he reached into the cage to grab it and didn't have a proper grip. He still remembers the squeal of pain, but that gruesome incident became a defining moment in shaping his approach to food -- every element is treated with dignity, and cooked in a way that celebrates it. Keller is one of the most thoughtful and precise of chefs, and it shows in every preparation. He's so exacting and particular that he has designed just about every plate and serving piece in the restaurant. About a year ago, he raised his menu price from $115 to $175, and recently also added an automatic gratuity, which is split among the staff -- much as Chez Panisse has been doing for years. While the price is formidable, with Keller's culinary genius and Laura Cunningham's front-of-the-house magic, the experience is well worth the extra dollars. The menu changes anywhere from 30 to 60 percent a night, depending on what's fresh that day.

While some fans hear that analysis and recoil in a Pavlovian fear created by years of watching the 17 quarterbacks go under center for the Dolphins since (Dan) Marino retired (say the name A.J.
